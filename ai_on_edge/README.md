# AI on the Edge: On-Device Machine Learning with Flutter & TensorFlow Lite

What if your app could recognize images, process voice commands, or detect gestures â€” all without sending data to the
cloud?

In this talk, weâ€™ll show you how to run real machine learning models directly on usersâ€™ devices using TensorFlow Lite
and Flutter. Learn to convert models, integrate them with the `tflite_flutter` plugin, and build apps that are fast,
private, and work completely offline.

Youâ€™ll get live demos like image classification and gesture recognition, plus tips on performance, optimization, and
deploying AI at the edge.

Whether youâ€™re new to ML or already experimenting, this session will equip you to add real-time, powerful AI to your
Flutter apps â€” no cloud required.
