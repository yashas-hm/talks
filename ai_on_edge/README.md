# AI on the Edge: On-Device Machine Learning with Flutter & TensorFlow Lite

What if your app could recognize images, process voice commands, or detect gestures, all without sending data to the
cloud?

In this talk, we’ll show you how to run real machine learning models directly on users’ devices using TensorFlow Lite
and Flutter. Learn to convert models, integrate them with the `tflite_flutter` plugin, and build apps that are fast,
private, and work completely offline.

You’ll get live demos like image classification and gesture recognition, plus tips on performance, optimization, and
deploying AI at the edge.

Whether you’re new to ML or already experimenting, this session will equip you to add real-time, powerful AI to your
Flutter apps no cloud required.
