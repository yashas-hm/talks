# Smooth as Butter: Building Beautiful Animations in Flutter

Animations arenâ€™t just decoration; theyâ€™re the secret sauce that makes an interface feel smooth, intuitive, and alive.

In this talk, weâ€™ll tour Flutterâ€™s full animation toolkit, from quick wins with `AnimatedContainer` to fully custom
motion crafted with `AnimationController`. Youâ€™ll discover:

- The difference between implicit and explicit animations
- How to pull off buttery-smooth Hero transitions
- Techniques to layer motion without tanking performance

Packed with live demos, battle-tested UI patterns, and copy-paste-ready code, this session will leave you ready to
animate with confidence, whether youâ€™re new to Flutter or looking to level up your UI game.
